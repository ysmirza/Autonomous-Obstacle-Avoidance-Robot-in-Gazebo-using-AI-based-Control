# Autonomous-Obstacle-Avoidance-Robot-in-Gazebo-using-AI-based-Control
Developed and simulated an intelligent mobile robot capable of autonomously navigating and avoiding obstacles in a Gazebo environment. The system integrates AI-based decision-making algorithms with sensor feedback to plan safe paths and ensure smooth real-time movement within dynamic environments.
